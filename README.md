# L99

Solutions for 99 Lisp problems in Common Lisp.

[99 Lisp problems](https://www.ic.unicamp.br/~meidanis/courses/mc336/problemas-lisp/L-99_Ninety-Nine_Lisp_Problems.html) is the Lisp version of 99 Prolog problems. It is a classic and interesting problem set for training programming. I tried to solve them with pure Common Lisp without any third-party supports, all solutions are shipped with testcases, verified with SBCL-2.5.11 . All in one org document.
